# Kernel_Image_Processing

Thsi project concerns image processing through a mask called kernel.
(it is used for blurring, sharpening, embossing, edge detection and more). 
The process takes place through a convolution between a kernel and an image.
Below is an example of animation of how the convolution process works:

The filters available in this project are the following:
 - Gaussian Blur
 - Sobel Edge
 - Sharpen
 - Edge Detection
 - Emboss
  
The convolution process of this project takes place on ppm and pgm images

Below is an example photo of the processing with sobel edge kernel:
