# Kernel_Image_Processing

Image processing through a kernel.
It is used for blurring, sharpening, embossing, edge detection and more. 
The process occurs through a convolution between a kernel and an image.

The filters available in this project are the following:
 - Gaussian Blur
 - Sobel Edge
 - Sharpen
 - Edge Detection
 - Emboss
  
The convolution process takes place on ppm and pgm images
